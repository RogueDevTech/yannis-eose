/**
 * Derive a synthetic "optimistic" row from a fetcher's submission payload and
 * merge it into the list while the post-action loader revalidates.
 *
 * **Lifecycle (default — `awaitSuccess: true`):**
 *   1. User clicks Submit. `fetcher.state` → `'submitting'`. **No synthetic
 *      row yet** — the action hasn't confirmed.
 *   2. Server returns `{ success: true }`. `fetcher.data` flips, the modal
 *      closes (via `useCloseOnFetcherSuccess`), and on the SAME React tick
 *      the synthetic row appears in the list.
 *   3. Loader revalidates (`fetcher.state` = `'loading'`). The real row lands.
 *   4. `fetcher.state` → `'idle'`. Synthetic row drops; real row stays.
 *
 * The synthetic row is purely a bridge between modal-close and loader-
 * revalidation. The user never sees "row appears, then disappears" because
 * we wait for confirmation before showing anything.
 *
 * **Why the default is `awaitSuccess: true` (CEO directive 2026-05):** the
 * earlier "show during submit" model briefly painted rows that the server
 * could still reject, leading to flicker on bad input. Waiting for success
 * makes every visible row a row that landed.
 *
 * **Failure path:** if the server returns `{ success: false }` or throws,
 * `fetcher.data.success` is never `true` so the synthetic row never renders,
 * and the modal stays open with the form values intact. The user sees their
 * error toast and can retry without losing input.
 *
 * The `build` callback is the only per-page logic. It receives the live
 * `FormData` plus the resolved `intent` string (from the `name="intent"`
 * hidden input) and returns either the synthetic rows OR `null` when the
 * intent doesn't apply to this list. Use `optimisticId(...)` from
 * `~/lib/optimistic` for the row ID so consumers can mark + disable.
 *
 * Canonical reference: `apps/web/app/features/logistics/LogisticsPage.tsx`.
 *
 * @example
 *   const optimisticProviders = useOptimisticListMerge<Provider>(fetcher, (fd, intent) => {
 *     if (intent !== 'createProvider') return null;
 *     const name = fd.get('name')?.toString().trim();
 *     if (!name) return null;
 *     return [{ id: optimisticId(), name, status: 'ACTIVE', createdAt: new Date().toISOString(), ... }];
 *   });
 *   const display = useMemo(
 *     () => [...optimisticProviders, ...providers],
 *     [providers, optimisticProviders],
 *   );
